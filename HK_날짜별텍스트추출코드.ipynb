wave of outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 epidemic coming inexorably last month, the numbers of confirmed patients and cases with unknown sources of infection have both surged sharply to record highs.  Regarding the anti-epidemic measures, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n\\n(1)as there are views that mandatory universal testing helps identify most of the asymptomatic infected persons and cut the transmission chain, thereby ameliorating the epidemic, under what circumstances that the Government will consider implementing mandatory universal testing;\\r\\n(2)given that at present, quite a number of members of the public have been infected allegedly due to attending private meal gatherings or parties, whether the Government will enact legislation to extend to private premises the stipulations concerning the prohibition on group gathering and the infection control measures for the catering industry; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and\\r\\n(3)whether it will follow the health code system implemented in Mainland cities by restricting those who are unable to produce a digital health code for verifying their health conditions from entering certain types of premises or taking public transport; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 2 \\r\\n(For oral reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nProposal to split the Transport and Housing Bureau\\r\\n\\nHon Frankie YICK to ask:\\n\\r\\nThe Transport and Housing Bureau oversees two major policy areas concerning the dwellings for and movements of the public, which means that the Bureau needs to formulate housing policies and implement measures for resolving housing issues, and formulate transport policies in relation to air services, land and maritime transport, as well as logistics development, with a view to reinforcing the status of Hong Kong as a premier transportation and logistics hub in Asia as well as an international maritime centre.  In view of the heavy workload of the Bureau, there have been voices in society suggesting that the Bureau should be split into two policy bureaux.  Besides, as the Chief Executive stated in the 2018 Policy Address, she agreed that there was such a need, and the Government would conduct a study on how to implement the suggestion.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council of the scope of the study, the proposals under consideration, the progress made so far, and the timetable for implementing the proposal concerned?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 3 \\r\\n(For oral reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nAdministration of the estate of the late Mrs Nina WANG\\r\\n\\nDr Hon Priscilla LEUNG to ask:\\n\\r\\nThe Court of Final Appeal handed down a judgment on 18 May 2015, which held that the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (\"the Foundation\") was to hold the estate of the late Mrs Nina WANG (\"the estate\") as a trustee, rather than receiving the estate as an unconditional absolute gift; moreover, the Secretary for Justice (\"SJ\") and the Foundation\\'s Board of Governors were required to formulate an administration scheme for the estate, including the establishment of a supervisory managing organization, to ensure that the estate would be used for charitable purposes in accordance with the testamentary intention of Mrs WANG.  Nevertheless, it has been over five years since the judgment was handed down, but the supervisory managing organization has yet to be established and the estate is still under the administration of the interim administrators of the estate appointed by the Court (\"the administrators\").  It has been reported that the administrators collect from the estate a fee as high as $60 million per annum.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)whether it knows the total current value of the estate, the total amount of fees charged by the administrators and relevant parties since 2012, as well as the amount appropriated from the estate for charitable purposes in each of the past three years;\\r\\n(2)how SJ, as the protector of charities, monitors if the expenses for the estate are reasonable and necessary, so as to ensure that the estate will not be gnawed by the exorbitant management fees, thus causing a significant reduction in its resources that may be used for charitable purposes; and\\r\\n(3)whether SJ will request the Foundation to expedite its handling of the matters relating to the establishment of the supervisory managing organization, so that the estate may expeditiously be used for charitable purposes, including helping members of the public affected by the epidemic?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 4 \\r\\n(For oral reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nFreezing the bank accounts of members of the public\\r\\n\\nDr Hon Cheng Chung-tai to ask:\\n\\r\\nIt has been reported that a Hong Kong resident who had been admitted to bail pending trial discovered, after announcing outside Hong Kong that he had gone on exile, that the deposits of several million dollars in several bank accounts belonging to himself and his family members had all been frozen, but some of such bank accounts were unfrozen one day later.  The Police subsequently acknowledged that they had frozen a deposit of $850,000 of an absconding Hong Kong resident.  Some members of the public have queried that the aforesaid practice of the Police may have violated the provision of the Basic Law regarding protection of private properties, and dealt a blow to the public\\'s confidence in Hong Kong\\'s financial system, thereby undermining Hong Kong\\'s status as an international financial centre.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)whether the law enforcement agencies may, without any restraint order issued by the court, direct banks to freeze the deposits in the accounts of any person who has allegedly broken the law; if so, of the legal basis;\\r\\n(2)under what circumstances the law enforcement agencies will unfreeze frozen deposits within a short period of time; and\\r\\n(3)whether it is a standing practice of the Police to freeze the assets of absconders and their families; if so, how the Government ensures that such practice will not undermine the confidence of the international community in Hong Kong\\'s financial system?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 5 \\r\\n(For oral reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nGovernment public transport fare concession scheme\\r\\n\\nHon CHAN Hak-kan to ask:\\n\\r\\nThe Government announced in January this year that the eligible age of the \"Government Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme for the Elderly and Eligible Persons with Disabilities\" (\"the Concession Scheme\") would be lowered from 65 to 60.  The Chief Executive indicated in November that the Government had largely completed the assessment, and on the premise of combating and preventing abuse effectively, it would include the funding required for the measure in the Budget for the next financial year with a view to implementing the measure progressively.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)of the latest progress of the implementation of the measure; the estimated recurrent expenditure to be incurred in each of the first three years of implementing the measure, and the percentages of administrative cost in such expenditures;\\r\\n(2)whether it has estimated the public expenditure incurred since January this year as a result of the Concession Scheme being abused; of the number of Elder Octopus Cards currently in active use, and whether this number matches the number of elderly people who travel frequently; and\\r\\n(3)of the number of suspected cases of abuse of the Concession Scheme uncovered since January this year as a result of the site monitoring surveys conducted by the Transport Department (\"TD\"); given that TD uncovered only 11 such cases last year, whether it has reviewed if law enforcement by TD was perfunctory, and what new measures it will take to prevent the Concession Scheme from being abused?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 6 \\r\\n(For oral reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nProblem of illegal parking\\r\\n\\nHon CHUNG Kwok-pan to ask:\\n\\r\\nSome members of the public have pointed out that the problem of illegal parking in various districts throughout Hong Kong has become serious since the eruption of the disturbances arising from the opposition to the proposed legislative amendments in June last year.  Illegal parking not only causes traffic obstruction but also jeopardizes the safety of pedestrians.  Even though the Police have recently stepped up efforts in combating illegal parking, the situation has not been improved significantly.  Such members of the public consider that this situation is related to the weakening of the law-abiding awareness of Hong Kong people.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)of the number of fixed penalty notices issued by the Police in each month between June and November this year in respect of illegally parked vehicles, with a breakdown by police region; how such figures compare with the relevant figures of the same periods in the past three years;\\r\\n(2)of the respective numbers of complaints about illegal parking received from members of the public by the Police and the Transport Department in each month of the past three years and, among them, the numbers of those not handled immediately by the Police; whether there is a significant difference between the relevant figures of last year and the respective figures of the two years before last year; and\\r\\n(3)of the new measures to be taken by the authorities to combat illegal parking and enhance the awareness of motorists of complying with traffic regulations?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 7 \\r\\n(For written reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nHillside escalators and elevators\\r\\n\\nHon Michael TIEN to ask:\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, the Government established a mechanism for assessing proposals on hillside escalator links and elevator systems (\"HEL\") (\"the assessment mechanism\").  Upon completion of initial screening and scoring for the proposals received then, the Government decided to take forward 18 of such proposals (\"first-batch projects\").  In 2017, the Government announced that a consultancy study would be conducted to review and improve the assessment mechanism, and by then the Government received a total of 114 HEL proposals.  The Government indicated at the end of 2019 that it planned, by 2020, to complete the scoring for those 114 proposals and determine the projects for priority implementation.  However, most of the first-batch projects have yet to be implemented.  Quite a number of members of the public look forward to an early implementation of such projects and proposals, to spare them the toil of climbing up long steep roads or stairs of more than a hundred steps every day.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)of the latest state of implementation of the first-batch projects;\\r\\n(2)whether it has completed the work of initial screening and scoring for the aforesaid 114 proposals and determining the projects for priority implementation; if so, of the details; if not, the expected completion date;\\r\\n(3)whether it has plans to take on more HEL proposals within the coming three years; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and\\r\\n(4)given that among the scoring criteria, the maximum score for the item of \"number of beneficiaries and target\" is 60, and the maximum scores for the two criteria under it, i.e. \"expected daily pedestrian flow of the proposed HEL\" and \"proportion of 65 year-old or above population and whether there is any hospital/rehabilitation centre/nursing home in the beneficial catchment\", are 40 and 20 respectively, but there are views that these two criteria should be given equal weighting (i.e. each to have a maximum score of 30), so as to adequately address the needs of the elderly and mobility impaired persons, whether the Government will adopt this suggestion; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?  â\\x80\\x83\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 8 \\r\\n(For written reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nThe \"LeaveHomeSafe\" mobile application\\r\\n\\nHon WONG Kwok-kin to ask:\\n\\r\\nTo help the epidemiological tracing work in respect of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 epidemic, the Government launched, on the 16th of last month, a mobile application named \"LeaveHomeSafe\" (\"the app\") for voluntary download and use by members of the public.  Later on, the Government required all catering businesses and scheduled premises under the Prevention and Control of Disease (Requirements and Directions) (Business and Premises) Regulation (Cap. 599F) opening for business to apply for a LeaveHomeSafe venue QR code (\"QR code\") from the Government before the 3rd of this month, and to display the QR code at a conspicuous position at the entrance of the premises within two working days upon receipt of the QR code.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)of the current number of premises issued with a QR code, as well as the number of downloads of the app; whether it has estimated the number of people who have used the app;\\r\\n(2)whether it will enhance the functions of the app, including sending automatic push notifications to users when they enter premises where a QR code has been displayed, so as to remind them to scan the QR code to record their whereabouts;\\r\\n(3)whether it will develop other tracing tools for free use by those people who do not use smartphones (e.g. the elderly and the poverty stricken); and\\r\\n(4)whether it will make download and use of the app mandatory for members of the public and introduce relevant penalties, with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of the anti-epidemic efforts?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 9 \\r\\n(For written reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nClosed roads in south Lantau\\r\\n\\nHon Wilson OR to ask:\\n\\r\\nThe Government has designated the roads in south Lantau as closed roads.

Such tableware, which is difficult to degrade naturally, has been discarded as household waste, putting a heavy burden on the ecological environment.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)whether it has studied imposing regulation on disposable tableware in respect of the materials used, its use etc., for instance, requiring restaurants to use tableware made of naturally degradable materials only;\\r\\n(2)whether any policy is currently in place to properly deal with discarded disposable tableware;

Quite a number of members of the public have relayed that the Government, apart from improving the welfare for the elderly, should also encourage the elderly (especially persons aged 60 to 64 who are commonly known as \"silver-age persons\") to seek employment and participate in community services.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)as the Government indicated last month that it would include the funding needed for expanding the Concession Scheme in the Budget for the next financial year with a view to implementing the measure progressively, of the specific date for implementing the expanded Concession Scheme;\\r\\n(2)as the Government indicated that it would study issuing to persons aged 60 or above a Personalized Octopus Card embodied with the functions of a Senior Citizen Card issued by the Social Welfare Department, of the progress of the study and the implementation date of the relevant initiative;\\r\\n(3)as the Government indicated that it would (i) combine the Normal OALA (currently at $2,770 per month) and the Higher OALA (currently at $3,715 per month), (ii) standardize the monthly allowance at the Higher OALA rate, and (iii) raise the asset limits for applying for the allowance (to $500,000 for a single elderly person and $750,000 for a married elderly couple), of the implementation date(s) of these initiatives;\\r\\n(4)whether the Government will consider reducing by half the salaries tax rate for working people aged 60 or above, so as to encourage the elderly to continue working; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;\\r\\n(5)given that quite a number of persons who are required to retire from their current positions upon reaching the age of 60 wish to take up employment again, engage in part-time work or even start their own businesses, whether the Government will (i) enact legislation relating to re-employment after retirement and rationalize the relevant arrangements of the Mandatory Provident Fund system, and (ii) introduce measures to encourage employers to offer more positions suitable for the elderly; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and\\r\\n(6)of the new measures in place to encourage silver-age persons to actively participate in neighbourhood mutual help, volunteer services as well as social affairs in the community?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 20 \\r\\n(For written reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nAssisting the vehicle repair trade in obtaining\\r\\nrepair information and techniques\\r\\n\\nHon Frankie YICK to ask:\\n\\r\\nIt is learnt that with the extensive use of electronic components in diesel vehicles of Euro IV and post-Euro IV emission standards, it is necessary for the vehicle repair trade to obtain the checkers and software of the On Board Diagnostic systems developed by vehicle manufacturers for these vehicles as well as the data collected from tests conducted by the original manufacturers (\"the software and hardware required for repair\"), so as to effectively repair the major parts of these vehicles.  Some members of the local vehicle repair trade have indicated that as vehicle repair workshops in general can hardly afford to purchase and keep the software and hardware required for repair for various vehicle models, vehicle owners can only send their vehicles in need of repair back to the repair workshops designated by vehicle dealers for repair and, in the absence of competition, the repair services provided by the latter not only have failed to meet market needs, but also charged a fee on the high side.  This situation has resulted in an increase in the operating costs of the transport trade and a gradual shrinkage of the room for survival of the vehicle repair trade.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)whether it knows the number and percentage of vehicle repair workshops which closed down in each of the past five years and, among them, the number of those which closed down because they could not afford the software and hardware required for repair;\\r\\n(2)as the European Union (\"EU\") has required vehicle manufacturers to ensure that independent repair operators have easy, restriction-free, and standardized access to information on the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and not to treat authorized dealers and repair workshops differently, whether the Government will require that local dealers of new vehicle models must, upon payment of a reasonable fee by members of the vehicle repair trade, provide the software and hardware required for repair; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;\\r\\n(3)as the Government indicated in its reply to my question on 17 February 2016 that the Government would follow the practice of EU to include in the legislation the requirement for vehicle manufacturers to open up repair techniques, of the progress of the legislative amendment exercise; whether it has taken the initiative to gain an understanding from the vehicle repair trade of the opening up of repair techniques by vehicle manufacturers; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and\\r\\n(4)of the measures in place to assist the vehicle repair trade in keeping abreast of the latest vehicle repair information and techniques?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 21 \\r\\n(For written reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nFlood prevention measures for villages\\r\\n\\nHon CHAN Hak-kan to ask:\\n\\r\\nWith the continuous aggravation of global warming, extreme weather conditions have hit Hong Kong more frequently in recent years.  During a number of severe rainstorms this year, serious flooding occurred in certain villages (including the following villages in New Territories East: Lo Wu Village, Ping Yeung Village and Lei Uk Village in Ta Kwu Ling; Cheung Uk Tei Village, Yue Kok Village, Shuen Wan Chim Uk Village, Shuen Wan Chan Uk Village, Wong Yue Tan Village and San Tau Kok Village in Tai Po; as well as Ha Tei Ha Village in Sha Tin), threatening the safety of villagers\\' lives and properties.  Regarding flood prevention measures for villages, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)of the follow-up actions taken by the relevant government departments in respect of the flooding problems in the aforesaid villages; whether they will roll out improvement measures; if so, of the timetables;\\r\\n(2)of the number of reports on flooding incidents in villages received by the Government since January this year, with a breakdown by District Council district; among such incidents, of the respective numbers of those the causes of which involved problems of (i) blockage of outfalls and (ii) inadequate flood relieving capacities of drainage channels; the details and progress of the follow-up actions taken in respect of such flooding incidents; the number of locations where the flooding problems have yet to be resolved and the relevant details; and\\r\\n(3)as the Government has recently proposed carrying out a number of district minor works projects so as to resolve the flooding problems in certain villages, but quite a number of villagers have relayed that funding approval for some of the projects (e.g. the project in San Tau Kok Village in Tai Po) has not been granted by the District Councils concerned after a protracted period of time, resulting in indefinite delay in their implementation, how the Government will resolve such problem; whether it will strengthen the Government\\'s role in taking forward district works; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 22 \\r\\n(For written reply)\\r\\n(Translation)\\r\\n \\r\\nPrimary healthcare services\\r\\n\\nHon Holden CHOW to ask:\\n\\r\\nTo shift the emphasis of the present healthcare system and people\\'s mindset from treatment-oriented to prevention-focused, the Government plans to set up full-fledged District Health Centres (\"DHCs\") or interim DHC Expresses of a smaller scale in all of the 18 districts across the territory, with a view to strengthening district-based primary healthcare services, as well as encouraging the public to maintain a healthy lifestyle and enhancing their capability in self-care and home care, thereby reducing the need for specialist services and hospitalization.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\\r\\n(1)of the respective numbers of members of Kwai Tsing DHC who have been provided with (i) basic health risk assessment and (ii) screening services for diabetes mellitus and hypertension, together with the number of patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension who have been covered by the Chronic Disease Management Programme, since the DHC commenced operation in September last year;\\r\\n(2)of the respective current numbers of persons suffering from post-acute myocardial infarction, stroke and hip fracture who are receiving community rehabilitation services provided by Kwai Tsing DHC;\\r\\n(3)given that the Government plans to set up, within its current term, DHCs in seven districts (namely Kwai Tsing, Sham Shui Po, Wong Tai Sin, Tsuen Wan, Yuen Long, Tuen Mun and Southern District) and DHC Expresses in 11 districts, of the progress and other details of the work of setting up these facilities (including site selection), as well as the specific dates on which these facilities will be set up; and\\r\\n(4)whether it will consider expanding the scope of the disease screening services of DHCs to cover cervical cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

Regarding the anti-epidemic measures, will the Government inform this Council:\n",
            "(1)as there are views that mandatory universal testing helps identify most of the asymptomatic infected persons and cut the transmission chain, thereby ameliorating the epidemic, under what circumstances that the Government will consider implementing mandatory universal testing;\n",
            "(2)given that at present, quite a number of members of the public have been infected allegedly due to attending private meal gatherings or parties, whether the Government will enact legislation to extend to private premises the stipulations concerning the prohibition on group gathering and the infection control measures for the catering industry; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and\n",
            "(3)whether it will follow the health code system implemented in Mainland cities by restricting those who are unable to produce a digital health code for verifying their health conditions from entering certain types of premises or taking public transport; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?\n",
            "The Transport and Housing Bureau oversees two major policy areas concerning the dwellings for and movements of the public, which means that the Bureau needs to formulate housing policies and implement measures for resolving housing issues, and formulate transport policies in relation to air services, land and maritime transport, as well as logistics development, with a view to reinforcing the status of Hong Kong as a premier transportation and logistics hub in Asia as well as an international maritime centre.  In view of the heavy workload of the Bureau, there have been voices in society suggesting that the Bureau should be split into two policy bureaux.  Besides, as the Chief Executive stated in the 2018 Policy Address, she agreed that there was such a need, and the Government would conduct a study on how to implement the suggestion.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council of the scope of the study, the proposals under consideration, the progress made so far, and the timetable for implementing the proposal concerned?\n",

Nevertheless, it has been over five years since the judgment was handed down, but the supervisory managing organization has yet to be established and the estate is still under the administration of the interim administrators of the estate appointed by the Court (\"the administrators\").  It has been reported that the administrators collect from the estate a fee as high as $60 million per annum.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\n",
            "(1)whether it knows the total current value of the estate, the total amount of fees charged by the administrators and relevant parties since 2012, as well as the amount appropriated from the estate for charitable purposes in each of the past three years;\n",
            "(2)how SJ, as the protector of charities, monitors if the expenses for the estate are reasonable and necessary, so as to ensure that the estate will not be gnawed by the exorbitant management fees, thus causing a significant reduction in its resources that may be used for charitable purposes; and\n",
            "(3)whether SJ will request the Foundation to expedite its handling of the matters relating to the establishment of the supervisory managing organization, so that the estate may expeditiously be used for charitable purposes, including helping members of the public affected by the epidemic?\n",

The Police subsequently acknowledged that they had frozen a deposit of $850,000 of an absconding Hong Kong resident.  Some members of the public have queried that the aforesaid practice of the Police may have violated the provision of the Basic Law regarding protection of private properties, and dealt a blow to the public's confidence in Hong Kong's financial system, thereby undermining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\n",

            "Some members of the public have pointed out that the problem of illegal parking in various districts throughout Hong Kong has become serious since the eruption of the disturbances arising from the opposition to the proposed legislative amendments in June last year.  Illegal parking not only causes traffic obstruction but also jeopardizes the safety of pedestrians.  Even though the Police have recently stepped up efforts in combating illegal parking, the situation has not been improved significantly.  Such members of the public consider that this situation is related to the weakening of the law-abiding awareness of Hong Kong people.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\n",
            "(1)of the number of fixed penalty notices issued by the Police in each month between June and November this year in respect of illegally parked vehicles, with a breakdown by police region; how such figures compare with the relevant figures of the same periods in the past three years;\n",

Upon completion of initial screening and scoring for the proposals received then, the Government decided to take forward 18 of such proposals (\"first-batch projects\").  In 2017, the Government announced that a consultancy study would be conducted to review and improve the assessment mechanism, and by then the Government received a total of 114 HEL proposals.  The Government indicated at the end of 2019 that it planned, by 2020, to complete the scoring for those 114 proposals and determine the projects for priority implementation.  However, most of the first-batch projects have yet to be implemented.  Quite a number of members of the public look forward to an early implementation of such projects and proposals, to spare them the toil of climbing up long steep roads or stairs of more than a hundred steps every day.

Later on, the Government required all catering businesses and scheduled premises under the Prevention and Control of Disease (Requirements and Directions) (Business and Premises) Regulation (Cap. 599F) opening for business to apply for a LeaveHomeSafe venue QR code (\"QR code\") from the Government before the 3rd of this month, and to display the QR code at a conspicuous position at the entrance of the premises within two working days upon receipt of the QR code.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\n",

In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:\n",
